### Folder structure:
- model_utils.py

All models I have tried
- data_utils.py

Preparing data from scratch (without using torchtext), including wrappers which generate data variable length data batches for training. 
- train_utils.py

Functions used for training and calculating losses during training
- evaluation.py

Calculation of f1 scores 
- submission.py

This generates prediction.txt.
- preprocessing.ipynb

Notebook for preprocessing.

- run.ipynb
The starting point. This is where I import all other functions from \*.py files and get results.
